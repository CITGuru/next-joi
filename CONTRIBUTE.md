# How to contribute to the project?

Since the project is quite small, let's try to keep things simple ðŸ™‚

- If there is bug or typo you would like to address, please go and open a Pull Request. As a general guideline, try to keep things consistent with the existing code.
- For a feature request, [create a new issue](https://github.com/codecoolture/next-joi/issues/new/choose) so we can discuss its viability.
